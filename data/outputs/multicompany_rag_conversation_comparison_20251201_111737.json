The company designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of products, including smartphones (iPhone), personal computers (Mac), tablets (iPad), wearables, and accessories [AAPL Source 1]. Apple also offers a range of services, including cloud services, advertising services, and fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare brand [AAPL Source 1]. \n\nApple's business is organized geographically, with reportable segments in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Rest of Asia Pacific. The company sells its products directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force, as well as through indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and resellers [AAPL Source 2]. \n\nIn addition to hardware sales, Apple also generates revenue from digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, and Apple TV+ [AAPL Source 3].
